# Artificial-Intelligence-for-Robotics

This notebook coded the alogrithms talked in the [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs373/lessons/48739381/concepts/487350240923)

It covers the **following alogrithms:**
###State Estimation and Localization:
* Monte Carlo Localization
* Histogram Filters
* Kalman Filters
* Particle Filters

###Motion Planning:
* A* Alogrithm
* Dynamic Programming for deterministic motion
* Dynamic Programming for stochastic motion

###PID Control:
* Path Smoothing(Non-cyclic path smoothing, cyclic path smoothing, constrained path smoothing)
* PID Control
* Twiddle Algorithm for parameter optimization (Automatically Tuning kp, ki, and kd)

###Combined:
This notebook puts most of the algorithms talked in the class together including particle filters, A* algorithm, smoothing, PID control.
