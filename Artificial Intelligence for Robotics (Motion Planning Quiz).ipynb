    "# -------------------\n",
    "# Background Information\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In this problem, you will build a planner that helps a robot\n",
    "# find the shortest way in a warehouse filled with boxes\n",
    "# that he has to pick up and deliver to a drop zone.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# For example:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# warehouse = [[ 1, 2, 3],\n",
    "#              [ 0, 0, 0],\n",
    "#              [ 0, 0, 0]]\n",
    "# dropzone = [2,0] \n",
    "# todo = [2, 1]\n",
    "# \n",
    "# The robot starts at the dropzone.\n",
    "# The dropzone can be in any free corner of the warehouse map.\n",
    "# todo is a list of boxes to be picked up and delivered to the dropzone.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Robot can move diagonally, but the cost of a diagonal move is 1.5.\n",
    "# The cost of moving one step horizontally or vertically is 1.\n",
    "# So if the dropzone is at [2, 0], the cost to deliver box number 2\n",
    "# would be 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To pick up a box, the robot has to move into the same cell as the box.\n",
    "# When the robot picks up a box, that cell becomes passable (marked 0)\n",
    "# The robot can pick up only one box at a time and once picked up \n",
    "# it has to return the box to the dropzone by moving onto the dropzone cell.\n",
    "# Once the robot has stepped on the dropzone, the box is taken away, \n",
    "# and it is free to continue with its todo list.\n",
    "# Tasks must be executed in the order that they are given in the todo list.\n",
    "# You may assume that in all warehouse maps, all boxes are\n",
    "# reachable from beginning (the robot is not boxed in).\n",
    "\n",
    "# -------------------\n",
    "# User Instructions\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Design a planner (any kind you like, so long as it works!)\n",
    "# in a function named plan() that takes as input three parameters: \n",
    "# warehouse, dropzone, and todo. See parameter info below.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Your function should RETURN the final, accumulated cost to do\n",
    "# all tasks in the todo list in the given order, which should\n",
    "# match with our answer. You may include print statements to show \n",
    "# the optimum path, but that will have no effect on grading.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Your solution must work for a variety of warehouse layouts and\n",
    "# any length of todo list.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Add your code at line 76.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# --------------------\n",
    "# Parameter Info\n",
